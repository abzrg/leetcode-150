## [Summary Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/description/)

### Runtime complexity

This solution goes through each element of the array once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

### Space complexity

The space complexity is O(1) for extra space (loop variables, ... which don't grow with the size of the input), excluding the space needed for the output vector, which depends on the number of ranges formed.
